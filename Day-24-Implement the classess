Question:

Implement classes Automobile, FamilyAutoSegment and LuxuryAutoSegment. FamilyAutoSegment and LuxuryAutoSegment classes inherits from the Automobile class. The attribute category is used to differentiate between segments. The categories are "family car"(default) and "luxury car"

a. Step 1: Define a give_details() method in the Automobile class that gives the class name and category

b. Step 2: The common attributes irrespective of segments are make, colour and year. The cars in the FamilyAutoSegment are characterized by mileage and in the LuxuryAutoSegment by engine capacity. Initialize the attributes appropriately. Implement a method show_attributes() in the Automobile class that gives the make, colour, year, and mileage/ engine capacity

c. Extend the show_attributes() methods in the FamilyAutoSegment and
LuxuryAutoSegment classes to display the attributes: 'calling from the class :
Internal to Wipro
FamilyAutoSegment/ LuxuryAutoSegment' and the then the rest of the attributes

Code:

class Automobile:
    def given_details(self, category="family car"):
        self.class_name=input("Enter the class name(FamilyAutoSegment / LuxuryAutoSegment):")
        self.category=input("Enter the category(family car/luxury car):")
        if not self.category.strip():
            self.category=category 
        if self.class_name not in ["FamilyAutoSegment","LuxuryAutoSegment"]:
            print("Enter the class name properly")
            self.given_details()
        else:
            self.make=input("Enter the make of the automobile:")
            self.color=input("Enter the color of the automobile:")
            self.year=int(input("Enter the year of the automobile:"))
            self.age=int(input("Enter the age of the automobile:"))
            
            if self.class_name=="FamilyAutoSegment":
                self.mileage=input("Enter the mileage of the automobile(low/high mileage):")
            else:
                self.engine_capacity=input("Enter the engine capacity of the automobile(big/small engine):")
                
    def show_attributes(self):
        
        print("Name of the class:",a.class_name)
        print("Category of the automobile:",a.category)
        print("Make of the automobile:",a.make)
        print("Color of the automobile:",a.color)
        print("Year of the automobile:",a.year)
        print("Age of the automobile:",a.age)
        if a.class_name=="FamilyAutoSegment":
            print("Mileage of the automobile:",a.mileage)
        else:
            print("Engine capacity of the automobile:",a.engine_capacity)
            
class FamilyAutoSegment(Automobile ):
    
    def show_attributes(self):
        print("*"*25)
        print(f"calling from the class: Internal to Wipro {self.__class__.__name__}")
        super().show_attributes()

            
class LuxuryAutoSegment(Automobile ):
    
    def show_attributes(self):
        print("*"*25)
        print(f"calling from the class: Internal to Wipro {self.__class__.__name__}")
        super().show_attributes()
        
a=Automobile()
f=FamilyAutoSegment()
l=LuxuryAutoSegment()
a.given_details()
if a.class_name=="FamilyAutoSegment":
    f.show_attributes()
else:
    l.show_attributes()
